# Lab - Governance for use case eKYC

## About the Organization
We are a financial institution. We will have customers onboarding to our organization to do financial transactions and crypto trading. We are using the eKYC model to verify our clients’ identities.

The foundations of Project governance are:

    Openness & Transparency
    Active Contribution
    Institutional Neutrality

## Corporate Structure

The project leadership was provided by LCrypto and a subset of Contributors, Core Developers, whose active and consistent contributions have been recognized by their receiving “commit rights” to the Project GitHub repositories. All Project decisions are made through consensus among the Core Developers with input from the Community. The LCrypto can, but rarely chooses to, override the Core Developers and make a final decision on a matter.

While this approach has served us well, as the Project grows and faces more legal and financial decisions and interacts with other institutions, we see a need for a more formal governance model. Moving forward The Project leadership will consist of a Lcrypto and Steering Council. We view this governance model as the formalization of what we are already doing, rather than a change in direction.
